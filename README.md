The Faces Game realized by Toporivschi Ion, a student for I.T.T. E. Barsanti during the last month of 4th grade.
The game rules are simple: you need to press a button as a face appears on screen, for example like this: the left corner corresponds to the left button, so then you see a face in the left of the screen you need to press the left button, etc.
There are three types of "faces": a happy face, an upset face and a heart. Each type has his own specifications, for example: upset face will make you lose a life if pressed, happy face will earn you a point, a heart will earn you a life and a point.
The amount of lives you have are shown in the top right corner of the screen, the maximum amount of lives is 5. If you reach this point you will no longer be able to increase your lives number.
The game ends after you reach 0 lives, you will be shown a total score you've achieved and also a way to play again, from the start.

Good luck and have fun playing!
